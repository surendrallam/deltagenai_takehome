# #To implement the objective of creating a workflow that generates personalized emails for leads using two different LLMs, here’s a structured approach. This will include data extraction, email construction, quality checking, and output generation along with orchestration and an exploration of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL).

# ### Step 1: Environment Setup

# #You need to set up your environment with necessary libraries. Ensure you have Python installed and then install the required libraries:

# # ```bash
# # pip install pandas openai
# # ```

# ### Step 2: Create the Python Script

# # Let’s create a Python script named `email_workflow.py`. This script will contain the workflow outlined in your problem statement.

# # ```python
# import pandas as pd
# import openai
# import time
# import json

# # Set your OpenAI API key
# openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'  # Replace with your OpenAI API key

# # Load CSV file
# def load_csv(file_path):
#     return pd.read_csv(file_path)

# # Extract lead data
# def extract_lead_data(df):
#     return df[['Name', 'Email', 'Company', 'Job Title']]

# # Define email template
# email_template = """
# Subject: Introducing {Product_Service} to Improve {Relevant_Aspect}

# Hi {Name},

# I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am reaching out to you from [Your Company]. I noticed that you are the {Job_Title} at {Company}, and I wanted to share how our {Product_Service} can help you with {specific_challenge}.

# [Personalized message based on the lead's company or job title]

# I'd love to discuss this further and see how we can assist you. Please let me know if you're available for a quick call next week.

# Best regards,

#             Company=lead_info['Company'],
#             Job_Title=lead_info['Job Title'],
#             Product_Service='procurement software',
#             Relevant_Aspect='procurement efficiency',
#             specific_challenge='streamlining your purchasing processes and reducing costs'
#         )
#         response = openai.Completion.create(
#             engine=model, 
#             prompt=prompt, 
#             max_tokens=200
#         )

#         return generate_email(template, lead_info, model)

# # Quality check between two generated emails
# def quality_check(email1, email2):
#     # Basic comparison logic, could be made more sophisticated
#     return email1 if len(email1) > len(email2) else email2

# # Main orchestration function
# def orchestrator(csv_file, output_file):
#     # Step 1: Load and extract data
#     leads_df = load_csv(csv_file)
#     leads_data = extract_lead_data(leads_df)

#     # Step 2: Generate emails
#     results = []
#     for index, lead in leads_data.iterrows():
#         email_llm1 = generate_email(email_template, lead, model="text-davinci-003")  # LLM 1
#         email_llm2 = generate_email(email_template, lead, model="gpt-3.5-turbo")      # LLM 2
        
#         best_email = quality_check(email_llm1, email_llm2)

#         results.append({
#             "name": lead['Name'],
#             "email": lead['Email'],
#             "company": lead['Company'],
#             "job_title": lead['Job Title'],
#             "email_llm_1": email_llm1,
#             "email_llm_2": email_llm2,
#             "selected_email": best_email
#         })

#     # Step 3: Store results
#     with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
#         json.dump(results, f, indent=4)

# # Running the orchestrator
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     csv_file_path = 'sample_leads_10.csv'  # Change this path as per your file location
#     output_file_path = 'personalized_emails.json'
#     orchestrator(csv_file_path, output_file_path)
# # ```

# ### Step 3: Create the CSV File

# Prepare your `sample_leads_10.csv` file with the required structure (Name, Email, Company, Job Title).

# ```csv
# Name,Email,Company,Job Title
# Jane Doe,jane.doe@example.com,Tech Solutions Inc.,Procurement Manager
# John Smith,john.smith@example.com,Delta Corp.,Head of Procurement
# ...
# ```

# ### Step 4: Execute the Script

# Run the script from your terminal:

# ```bash
# python email_workflow.py
# ```

# This will generate a JSON file named `personalized_emails.json` containing email drafts from both LLMs and indicates which one is selected as best.

# ### Step 5: README

# Create a `README.md` file in the same directory as your script with instructions:

# ```markdown
# # Email Personalization Workflow

# ## Objective
# This script extracts data from a CSV file of leads and uses OpenAI's API to generate personalized emails for each lead using two different language models. The outputs are compared, and the results are saved.

# ## Setup
# 1. Install required libraries:
#     ```
#     pip install pandas openai
#     ```
# 2. Set your OpenAI API key in the script.
# 3. Prepare the `sample_leads_10.csv` file.
# 4. Run the script:
#     ```
#     python email_workflow.py
#     ```

# ## Output
# The generated emails are stored in `personalized_emails.json`.
# ```

# ### Step 6: Exploring MORL (Optional)

# To implement Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for optimizing email content:

# 1. **Define Objectives**: You need to specify what metrics you want to optimize for (e.g., open rates, responses). 
# 2. **Iteration Loop**: You can run multiple iterations where you get feedback on the emails sent, adjust their content based on performance, and use reinforcement learning strategies to improve over time.

# This part can get complex and would typically require more setup with a proper machine learning framework, tracking user interaction with the emails.

# ### Step 7: Publish to GitHub

# 1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
# 2. Add your Python script and the README file.
# 3. Commit and push your changes.

# With this setup, you have a structured approach to generating and optimizing emails using LLMs based on your problem statement. If you have further questions or need additional features implemented, feel free to ask!

# To solve the problem statement you provided, involving the extraction of data from a CSV file, generating personalized emails for leads using two different LLMs, comparing the outputs, determining the best email, implementing orchestration, and exploring Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), the following steps can be followed:
